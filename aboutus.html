            The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA)
            before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. After initially
            determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933
            that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966. Following an agreement to merge the
            NFL with the rival American Football League (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine
            a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL
            season since the merger was completed in 1970.[7] Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591)
            of any professional sports league in the world[8] and is the most popular sports league in the United States.
            The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world, with the individual games accounting
            for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally
            of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.
            
            
            On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs,
            Cleveland Indians, and Dayton Triangles at the Jordan and Hupmobile auto showroom in Canton,
            Ohio. This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference
            (APFC), a group who, according to the Canton Evening Repository, intended to "raise the standard
            of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs
            and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules".
